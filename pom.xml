Project Overview: Micro-Learning Content Recommendation System

The Micro-Learning Content Recommendation System is a Spring Boot–based RESTful web application designed to deliver personalized, bite-sized learning content to users. The platform focuses on improving learning efficiency by recommending short, targeted micro-lessons based on a learner’s progress, preferences, and behavior.

The system supports role-based access where instructors create courses and micro-lessons, learners consume content and track progress, and the system intelligently recommends the next best lessons to enhance learning outcomes.

Purpose of the Project

Traditional e-learning platforms often overwhelm learners with long courses and generic content. This project solves that problem by:

Breaking learning into short micro-lessons

Tracking learner activity and mastery levels

Generating personalized recommendations

Ensuring secure and scalable access through JWT authentication

Core Objectives

Enable secure user registration and login using JWT

Allow instructors to create courses and upload micro-lessons

Allow learners to track lesson progress and completion

Provide intelligent lesson recommendations based on:

User progress

Difficulty level

Tags and topics

Learning preferences

Maintain data integrity, validation, and audit timestamps

Expose functionality through REST APIs with Swagger documentation
